## Story

The other day, when I was writing schema, irritability attacked me.

Gosh, I'm so fed up with json and yaml, is there a more comfortable way to write it?

After a simple attempt, I wrote the `JSS` project and developed a highlighting plugin, which improved readability and maintainability.

Next, I plan to add more convenient notation, such as `T!` for `required`, `T?` for `optional`, `@deprecated` for `deprecated: true`.

A longer term plan is to generate mock data based on this language, or infer schema from data, and generate structs.
